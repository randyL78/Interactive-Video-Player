					<span>connect your personal devices to the internet inside your house.</span>
					<span>Well there are many ways to connect to the internet, and</span>
					<span>most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let's look at an example of how you can connect to the internet.</span>
					<span>If you live in a city or a town, you probably have a coaxial cable for</span>
					<span>cable Internet, or a phone line if you have DSL, running to the outside of</span>
					<span>your house, that connects you to the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.</span>
					<span>If you live far out in the country, you'll more likely have</span>
					<span>a dish outside your house, connecting you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or</span>
					<span>you might also use the telephone system.</span>
